MvcMusicStore
=============

My work from the MvcMusicStore Tutorial Application

From : http://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/

Developed and tested as of 12-18-2014, working as expected.  
Housed here for retention, examples for working other mvc applications.
Relies on a simple flat data file to populate the models.  

Note -- 
-  Disregard the Membership and Authorization sections.  This technique  is deprecated.  
-  Some folders were moved around for ease in retention.  Folders packages and backup moved to within the MvcMusicStore.  If any of the references are broken on pulldown, reconfigure to point to the packages folder.  This can be done by editing the *.sln file with a text editor and setting the correct path to your *.csproj location.
